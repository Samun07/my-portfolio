        <p>
          I'm Samuel Sanchez from Bogota, Colombia, and I'm 22 years old. I've
          always stood out, whether it's because of my personality, my skills,
          or my creativity. I thrive on difficult challenges. When I start
          something, I make sure to finish it and give it my all. Whenever I
          learn something new, I like to dive deeper and really understand it. I
          love being in a constant state of learning and growth. I have big
          dreams and many goals I want to achieve.

              I graduated from school Gustavo Morales in Bogota, Colombia, after
              completing my five-year journey from first grade to fifth grade.
              During that time, I built a strong foundation in subjects such as
              mathematics, science, language arts, social studies, and physical
              education. Besides academic subjects, I gained valuable skills in
              teamwork, respect for diversity, and the importance of personal
              effort. Graduating from Colegio Gustavo Morales was a significant
              milestone that prepared me for future learning and growth,
              equipping me with the knowledge and values needed to navigate new
              challenges and achieve further success.

              I graduated from school Ibero Americano in Bogota, Colombia, where
              I completed six years of secondary education from sixth to
              eleventh grade. During that time, I built a solid academic
              foundation in subjects such as mathematics, science, languages,
              humanities, and arts. Besides academic pursuits, I developed
              critical thinking, communication skills, and a deep appreciation
              for cultural diversity. Graduating from Colegio Ibero Americano
              was a significant milestone in my educational journey, providing
              me with the knowledge and skills to pursue higher education and
              make meaningful contributions to society.

              I'm currently a student at Henry, specializing in web development.
              As I near the completion of my studies, I have developed robust
              skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks. Henry has
              not only equipped me with advanced technical knowledge but also
              provided hands-on experience through real-world projects. This has
              significantly enhanced my problem-solving abilities and expertise
              in design and usability. I am eager to apply my learning to
              innovative projects and aspire to contribute meaningfully as a web
              developer in the digital realm.
